There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# WaitTime #
 
## Heading ##
  > Wait time tells the user the amount of time a person would have to wait at a restaurant before being seated.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This app would be useful to both companies and restaurant goers.

## Summary ##
  > WaitTime will provide the wait time for a restaurant and will avoid the user from calling the restaurant to check. This app will also help restaurants with low traffic advertise their small wait time in an effort to get more customers.

## Problem ##
  > It is a big inconvenience for a person to go to a restaurant to find out that they have to wait an hour or more before being seated.

## Solution ##
  > WaitTime tells the user the time for a specified restaurant or the times of the restaurants nearby. In a way, this will divert the traffic to some restaurants that are usually busy to other restaurants that have significantly less traffic.

## How to Get Started ##
  > There are two ways to use this app. One way is to type in the type of food you would like and WaitTime will give you a list of restaurants within a specified proximity and their wait time. The other way is to type in the restaurant you want to go to and WaitTime will retrieve the expected amount of time you would have to wait.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This app helped me save so much time when going out. I no longer have to go through the disappointment of finding out that I have to wait a long period of time to get seated."
